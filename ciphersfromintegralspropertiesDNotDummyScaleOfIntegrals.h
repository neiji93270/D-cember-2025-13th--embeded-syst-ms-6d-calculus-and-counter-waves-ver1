//The ciphers for embeded systems that carry hidden machine internal web must rely on different topologies of pro p groups.
///Then, this is intuitive to thinl about a pre processor of ciphers communcating with devices. To overcome OS usage,
//we can omit large scale algebraic topologies values. So we rely on infinite ticks of chips and modulus of a certain pro p group.
//Then, it is best to hide topologies sniffed by attackers. To do that, we can use dummy signals to detect intruders and that said,
//we cannot omit signals scattering in a splatted gaussian heat of chips. So lets end messages of signals in 6d !
